# CoM estimation from custom sensor

# Sensor designs
The sensor designs are built to fit the Moveo arm (https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo)
STL files for the sensors can be found in /sensor_designs . Each sensor requires a base and a platform, in the platform should be inserted 3 force sensitive resistors (FSRs) - I used 20g to 2000g FSRs but larger or smaller ranges can be chosen dependant on your expected load.

The weight holder can also be found in this folder.

# Data collection
In order to start data collection run the /run.sh file.
